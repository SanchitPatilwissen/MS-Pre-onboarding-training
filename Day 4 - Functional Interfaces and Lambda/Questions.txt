Functional Interface

Common class to use in the example for practice. 
Create class Employee with fields firstName, lastName, id, dateOfBirth, salary, dept. 
Create class User with fields id, userName, password. 

Create logic for some predefined function interfaces below. 

Question 1: Create list of employees and print list of employess whose salary is above 2000. 

Write java 8 consumer which will print employee datails. Use this consumer to print results of methods whenever needed. 
Write java 8 predicate which can tell if employee salary is above 2000. Another option is Write BiPredicate where this 2000 is sent as another argument. 

Question 2 : Create List of Users from List of Employees.  

 Write java 8 Supplier which will generate 16 Character random password as String.  
 Write java 8 function which will take Employee input and will return object of class User. UserName should be firstName+LastName+YearOfBirth+id and password will be generated by supplier above, use id from Employee class as id.
   
	
Lambda: 

1. Write a program to Sort the list of employees by month in dateOfBirth. in Sort method use Lamda in comparator. 
2. Write a program to Create 2 threads using lambda. One thread will print list of employees another will print list of users. 
3. Write own functional interface UserNameGenerator which has generate method which accepts 4 parameters firstName,LastName,YearOfBirth,id. Write logic to implement generate() method using lamda and use it to generate User in question 2 above.
