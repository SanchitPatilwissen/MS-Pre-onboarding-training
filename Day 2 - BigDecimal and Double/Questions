1. We need to do rouding of numbers so that we can store them in Table Column with specific Precision and scale, without silent rounding.
Use BigDecimal
Given Column (p, s) = (25, 5)

e.g. "12345.12345467" => "12345.12345"
"12345.123456" => "12345.12346"

2. After rouding print the resulted number

3. Compare resulted number with expected number and print result.
